This is my quick attempt for a web-based bookkeeping
software. It's based on Django, a web framwork for Python,
see http://www.djangoproject.com/.

The database model is very simple: "Bookings" hold single 
credit or debit values for an "Account". A "Transaction"
groups several bookings and should be balanced. There
are "Invoices" that connect "Counterparts" with
"Transactions".

Data entry can be done via Django's built-in admin interface
but more comfortably via a few custom forms for the most common
cases.

Then there are several ways to look at the data, e.g.
the ledger, balance and account sheets etc.


TODO:
* make a view for the invoices, split page for customer/supplier
* finish the forms
* check that everything so far is calculated correctly

In the long run:
* JavaScript/AJAX for the forms
* convert the forms to Djangos form objects.
* a nice template/CSS
* multi-user management, authentification
